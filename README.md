Introduction of Zenith Chain


Zenith Chain is an innovative solution to bring programmability and interoperability. Zenith Chain relies on a system of 21 validators with Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) consensus that can support short block time and lower fees. The most bonded validator candidates of staking will become validators and produce blocks. The double-sign detection and other slashing logic guarantee security, stability, and chain finality.


The Zenith Chain also supports EVM-compatible smart contracts and protocols. Cross-chain transfer and other communication are possible due to native support of interoperability. The Zenith Chain will be:


A self-sovereign blockchain: Provides security and safety with elected validators.
EVM-compatible: Supports all the existing Ethereum tooling along with faster finality and cheaper transaction fees.
Interoperable: Comes with efficient native dual chain communication; Optimized for scaling high-performance dApps that require fast and smooth user experience.
Distributed with on-chain governance: Proof of Staked Authority brings in decentralization and community participants. As the native token, ZC will serve as both the gas of smart contract execution and tokens for staking.

The above fields should be fine for most purposes, although we'd recommend changing
the `nonce` to some random value so you prevent unknown remote nodes from being able
to connect to you. If you'd like to pre-fund some accounts for easier testing, create
the accounts and populate the `alloc` field with their addresses.
